the third article excluded any allegorical interpretation of the Gospel.
There is a certain group of theories which attempt to explain the problems at the
Fourth Gospel by explanations based on assumed textual Natasations. The
present strike of the Gospel is the result of an accident - prone history. The
original was written on a roll, or cookix, which tell into disorder or was
accidentally damaged. In editor, who was not the another, much what he
could at the chaos by placing the fragments, or sheets, or pages, in order.
The one real weakness of the Commentator's
case is that, in common with all his colleagues,
he has not, until now, been able to exhibit exactly
how this enlargement was effected nor has he
been able to explain the textual movements by
showing that such changes are part of a
simple and coherent plan. To understand how
this is possible it is necessary to examine the
text of the Gospel.
THE Fourth Gospel was almost certainly
written in Greek. A modern text of the
Gospel represents the work of generations of
scholars who have compared the many man in -
scripts of John and worked out the version
which is most likely to have been the original
working. It is not possible to establish any one
text with absolute precision.
The bar was the commonest working, but others
were also used. Acts sometimes served in place of the
bas, and there are cases where spacing is used as
it is now used to work a paragraph ending. Frequently
paragraphers markings were omitted. C.H. Roberts is of
the opinion that in the original of the Fourth Gospel
some markings would be used, Only which, it is
impossible to say.
Professor E. G. Turner is inclined to take view that
the original of the Gospel would be unworked. The
original at the Gospel, whether written on a roll or codex,
whether paragrophed or not, would be laid out in
columns. This is the unvariable practice of ancient
